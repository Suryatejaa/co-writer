# Security Fix - API Key Exposure

## Issue

GitHub push protection blocked commits due to detected OpenAI API keys in the following files:
1. `.env` - Line 3
2. `testNano.js` - Line 4
3. `testRobust.js` - Line 4

## Resolution

The actual API keys have been removed from all files and replaced with:
1. Environment variable references in production code
2. Placeholder values in test files with comments explaining proper usage

### Changes Made

1. **.env**: Replaced actual API keys with placeholder text and added comments explaining proper setup
2. **testNano.js**: Replaced hardcoded API key with `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "your_openai_api_key_here"`
3. **testRobust.js**: Replaced hardcoded API key with `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "your_openai_api_key_here"`
4. **README.md**: Updated with proper security instructions and setup guide
5. **aiService.js**: Already properly using `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_KEY`

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. All API keys are now loaded from environment variables
2. `.env` file remains in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
3. Added clear documentation on secure API key handling
4. Test files now use environment variables with fallback placeholders

## How to Use API Keys Securely

1. Obtain your own OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your system
3. For local development, you can also create a `.env` file (not committed) with your actual keys
4. For production deployment, set environment variables in your deployment platform

## Verification

After these changes, you should be able to push to GitHub without triggering security warnings.
