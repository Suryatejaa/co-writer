# 🔐 Firebase Authentication & Admin Setup Guide

This project implements **anonymous authentication** with **admin controls** for secure dataset management.

## ✅ **How It Works**

1. **Anonymous Sign-in**: Every visitor is automatically signed in anonymously when they open the app
2. **Admin Control**: Only users with UIDs in the `admins` collection can upload/modify datasets
3. **Secure Rules**: Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

---

## 🛠 **Step 1: Enable Anonymous Authentication**

### Firebase Console Setup:
1. Go to **Firebase Console** → **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
2. Enable **Anonymous** sign-in provider
3. Save changes

---

## 🛠 **Step 2: Deploy Firestore Rules**

### Apply Security Rules:
1. Copy the rules from `firestore.rules`
2. Go to **Firebase Console** → **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
3. Replace existing rules with the new ones
4. Click **Publish**

### What the rules do:
- ✅ **Anonymous users** can read/write scripts and analytics
- ✅ **Anonymous users** can read datasets and settings
- ✅ **Only admins** can write to datasets and settings
- ✅ **Admin collection** is read-only (prevents privilege escalation)

---

## 🛠 **Step 3: Set Up Admin Users**

### Make a User Admin:
1. Open your app and note your **User ID** from the admin panel
2. Go to **Firebase Console** → **Firestore Database**
3. Create a collection called `admins`
4. Add a document with **Document ID** = your User ID
5. Add any field (e.g., `enabled: true`, `role: "admin"`)
6. Refresh your app

### Example Admin Document:
```
Collection: admins
Document ID: ABC123xyz (your actual UID)
Fields:
  enabled: true
  role: "admin"
  addedDate: 2024-01-15
```

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### For Regular Users:
- ✅ Automatically signed in anonymously
- ✅ Can generate scripts
- ✅ Can view analytics
- ❌ Cannot upload datasets

### For Admin Users:
- ✅ All regular user permissions
- ✅ Can upload/modify datasets
- ✅ Can toggle AI mode
- ✅ Can view detailed admin panel

## 🔒 **Security Benefits**

1. **No Open Write Access**: Prevents spam/malicious uploads
2. **Anonymous Authentication**: No user registration required
3. **Admin-Only Controls**: Sensitive operations are protected
4. **Firestore Rules**: Server-side security enforcement
5. **UID-Based Access**: Scalable admin management

---

## 🚀 **Testing the Setup**

### Test Anonymous Auth:
1. Open the app in incognito mode
2. Check console for "✅ Anonymous sign-in successful"
3. Note the User ID displayed

### Test Admin Access:
1. Add your UID to `admins` collection
2. Refresh the app
3. Should see "🛡️ Admin Access Granted"
4. Upload functionality should be available

### Test Security:
1. Try accessing admin features without being in `admins` collection
2. Should see "🛡️ Admin Access Required" message
3. Firestore rules should block unauthorized writes

## 📱 **Mobile-First Design**

The authentication system respects user preferences:
- ✅ **Mobile-first approach**: Optimized for mobile devices
- ✅ **Consistent spacing**: p-2 (8px) and m-2 (8px) patterns
- ✅ **Responsive layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- ✅ **Proper accessibility**: Clear error messages and status indicators

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### "Anonymous sign-in failed"
- Check Firebase configuration in `.env`
- Ensure Anonymous auth is enabled in Firebase Console
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### "Admin Access Required"
- Verify your UID is in the `admins` collection
- Check Firestore rules are deployed
- Try refreshing the page

### "Firebase connection issues"
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify Firebase project settings
- App will fall back to offline mode gracefully
